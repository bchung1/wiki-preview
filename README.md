# wiki-preview
Have you ever been researching a new topic and it leads you to one wiki page and to another one and to another one... until 
you have 10 tabs and lost track of where you started?

Wiki-preview is a chrome extension that will provide a "preview" of a wiki link as a tooltip. This way you don't need to open dozens of tabs :D
